# University Press Workbench verification record

Verification date: September 9, 2026

Status: **Ready with conditions for a private pilot.** The application, both pinned skills, a live LunaRoute run, the browser interface, and one generated Word packet were tested. The review found and corrected defects; this record does not claim the system is secure or ready for unattended publication work.

## What passed

- GLM 5.3 foreground produced the file-level architecture and an adversarial design review through LunaRoute. The security pass returned `ready_with_conditions` and identified hostile DOCX content, manuscript prompt injection, credential leakage, source drift, SSRF, schema-valid false findings, and stale evidence as the main threats.
- A live `glm-5.3-background` run completed RCI and SEI in exactly two model calls. Both formal run results validate against their pinned package schemas.
- The synthetic chapter's source SHA-256 remained unchanged. Its embedded instruction to ignore the workbench rules was preserved as manuscript data, not followed, and surfaced to Editorial QA.
- The author copy contained 14 native Word comments, a visible review appendix, no external DOCX relationships, and no accepted edits. Its final three-page layout was inspected page by page in Microsoft Word rendering after the bundled LibreOffice renderer reported that LibreOffice was absent on this host.
- Browser smoke tests returned HTTP 200, served a restrictive CSP, injected a random per-process request token, loaded both pinned skills, scanned one chapter, and rejected a forged cross-origin state change with HTTP 403. No browser warnings or errors were logged.
- The repository secret scan found no embedded LunaRoute, OpenAI, GitHub, Google, or private-key values. The security pattern scan returned no candidates; that result is triage evidence, not proof of security.

## Automated checks

The repository CI repeats these checks on Windows:

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -m compileall -q upress_workbench
node --check upress_workbench/static/app.js
python vendor/reference-citation-integrity/scripts/validate_package.py
python vendor/reference-citation-integrity/evals/scorer.py --validate-suite
python vendor/scholarly-editorial-integrity/scripts/validate_package.py
python vendor/scholarly-editorial-integrity/evals/scorer.py --validate-suite --self-test
python scripts/check_no_secrets.py
ruff check .
bandit -q -r upress_workbench -s B606
pip-audit -r requirements.txt
```

The RCI suite contains 51 fixtures across 23 rules. The SEI suite contains 42 fixtures across 30 rules; its supplied self-test scored 42 of 42, including 20 of 20 zero-tolerance checks.

## Conditions before real chapter work

1. Rotate the LunaRoute credential that may have appeared in prior Codex history. Never commit the replacement.
2. Have a University Press steward approve `config/company-constitution.json`, `config/workbench-configuration.json`, the APA profile, and the unresolved decision hooks.
3. Confirm that LunaRoute is approved for each exact manuscript manifest. Restricted manuscripts remain blocked.
4. Run a supervised pilot on several representative chapters and review false positives, missed citations, comments, and author-facing tone.
5. Keep human acceptance and publication outside this application.

The current limits are deliberate: DOCX, Markdown, and UTF-8 text only; no PDF or OCR; no arbitrary URL fetches; no full-text source verification unless evidence is supplied; no automatic acceptance; and no publication action.
